This repository contains my work and results when investigating the baboon diversity dataset.

The notebooks contain comments detailing why they are run.

The workflows in the base directory are gwf workflows. Most of these workflows are small variations based on how to run Globetrotter on different datasets.

Major results will be published in an article currently titled Genome-wide coancestry reveals details of ancient and recent male-driven reticulation in baboons. Published work is based on notebooks in the dp and paint series.

Overview of notebook series:

dp: Data preparation

fs: F statistics

het: Heterozygosity investigation

hmm: Laurits Skov Hidden Markov Model for archaic ancestry

mask: Plots for the callability workflow

paint: Chromopainter, fineSTRUCTURE and Globetrotter visualizations

pca: PCAs based on vcf

snf: Investigation of private variants
