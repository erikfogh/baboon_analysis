## Baboon analysis

This repository contains my work and results when investigating the baboon diversity dataset.

The notebooks contain comments detailing why they are run.

The workflows in the base directory are gwf workflows. Most of these workflows are small variations based on how to run Globetrotter on different datasets.

Major results will be published in an article currently titled Genome-wide coancestry reveals details of ancient and recent male-driven reticulation in baboons
